## Description
This game was a "soft remake" of [Repeater](https://github.com/artificial-studio/archive-2015-repeater-gm81) with different concept and very different visuals. Initially Darkening was set to be a game where you have to keep your light and fight shadows, but it slowly grew to something closer to Hotline Miami. There was also a completely lost version between them of which I only have one small clip.
